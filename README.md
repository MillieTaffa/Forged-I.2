Welcome!

This test is meant to prepare you for three things:
1. Being in a WTC testing env + the style of WTC tests
2. Practicing loops and conditional logic
3. Practcing passing tests in time and using the beaker

All you need to do is to write code to pass the tests.

Please remember to make branches. Do a first initial push just to make sure you have push access and notify me if you dont.

git checkout -b <branch-name>

Goodluck!!❤️
